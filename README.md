Here’s a sample **README.md** for your repository. You can adjust sections like “Usage” and “Routes” to match actual functionality.

````

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/seif2222/Market.git
   cd Market
````

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate     # on Linux / macOS
   venv\Scripts\activate        # on Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   > *If there’s no `requirements.txt`, you can install Flask and any other needed packages manually.*

4. Initialize the database (if needed):

   ```bash
   flask db upgrade       # or your custom setup script
   ```

## Configuration

* By default, the app uses `market_system.db` in the `instance/` folder.
* You can configure the database path, debug mode, and Flask secret key by setting environment variables, or editing configuration values in `app.py` or `utils.py`.

## Usage

Start the Flask application:

```bash
flask run
```

Then open your browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:5000/
```

You should see the market dashboard or homepage.

If your app has a CLI (`main.py`) or printing utilities, you can run:

```bash
python main.py
```

or

```bash
python direct_print.py
```

depending on your workflow.

## Routes

| URL Path         | HTTP Method | Description                      |
| ---------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------- |
| `/`              | GET         | Home / index                     |
| `/products`      | GET, POST   | List and add products            |
| `/products/<id>` | GET, POST   | View/edit a specific product     |
| `/sales`         | GET, POST   | View and record sales            |
| `/import-excel`  | POST        | Upload Excel file to import data |
| `/export-excel`  | GET         | Download Excel report            |

> *Adjust route paths and methods based on your `routes.py` implementation.*

## Development

* Use a virtual environment.
* Keep your database backups separate.
* Write modular code: use `excel_utils.py` for Excel logic, `print_utils.py` for reporting/printing logic, and keep your route handlers focused in `routes.py`.
* Add tests in the future if you plan to expand functionality.

If you give me more details about how the routes are organized or what utility scripts do, I can refine the README further.
